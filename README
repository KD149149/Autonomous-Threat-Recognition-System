# Autonomous Threat Recognition System

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time Autonomous Threat Recognition system** using computer vision and deep learning.
It detects and highlights **weapons, vehicles, and hostile movement** from:

* Live laptop camera feed
* Pre-recorded video files

The system **records annotated video**, **logs detections**, and **generates an Excel report**, all saved with **date and time for traceability**.

---

## Key Features

* Real-time object and threat detection
* Supports live camera and video file input
* Bounding box highlighting with confidence score
* Press **`q`** to safely stop execution
* Automatic **date–time based video recording**
* Automatic **Excel threat report generation**
* Clean folder structure for audit and review

---

## Technology Stack

* Python 3.9+
* OpenCV
* YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
* Pandas
* OpenPyXL

---

```

---

## Installation

Install required dependencies:

```
pip install ultralytics opencv-python pandas openpyxl
```

---

## How to Run (SOP)

### Step 1: Start the program

```
python threat_detection.py
```

### Step 2: Select input source

* Enter **1** for live laptop camera
* Enter **2** for video file and provide file path

### Step 3: Monitoring

* Detection boxes and labels appear on the live feed
* Video is recorded automatically
* Detection data is logged internally

### Step 4: Quit safely

* Press **`q`** anytime to stop execution gracefully

---

## Output

After execution:

* Annotated video is saved with **date & time**
* Excel report is generated containing:

  * Date
  * Time
  * Threat Type
  * Detected Object
  * Confidence Score

---

## Supported Detection Categories

* Weapons (example: knife, gun – model dependent)
* Vehicles (car, truck, bus, motorbike)
* Human presence (used as hostile movement indicator)

---

## Notes

* Default model: `yolov8n.pt`
* Can be replaced with a **custom-trained model** for higher accuracy
* Works on CPU; GPU recommended for higher FPS

---

## Use Cases

* Smart surveillance
* Defense and law enforcement demos
* Critical infrastructure monitoring
* Research and academic projects

---

## Disclaimer

This system is intended for **research, demonstration, and assistive monitoring purposes**.
Final threat assessment should always involve **human validation**.
